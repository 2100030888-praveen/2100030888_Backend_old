Project Description:

Welcome to our location tracking project! In this project, we have designed a system that involves two key tables: "location" and "country". The connection between these tables is established through the use of foreign keys. Specifically, the primary key "country_id" from the "country" table is utilized as a foreign key in the "location" table, creating a relationship between the two.

Features:

Our project's homepage offers three main functionalities through intuitive buttons:

Insert Values: This button allows users to add records to both the "location" and "country" tables. It provides a seamless way to input new data into the system, ensuring that our database stays up-to-date with the latest information.
Execute SQL Queries: The second button is dedicated to executing SQL queries. The Queries given in the question.
Technologies Used:

To bring this project to life, we've leveraged the following technologies:

Python: The core programming language used for development.
Django: A powerful web framework for building web applications using Python.
MySQL Client: A Python package that enables communication with MySQL databases.
Homepage Layout:

Upon accessing the homepage, users will encounter the three main buttons mentioned above. Additionally, they will see two tables displaying the existing data from both the "location" and "country" tables. This layout provides users with a quick overview of the available data and allows them to interact with the system seamlessly.
